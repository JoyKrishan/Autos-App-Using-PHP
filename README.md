## Machine Learning Projects

1. **Logistic Regression with Neural Network mindset** - A cat classifier using logistic regression. One node with sigmoid activation function is used to classify cat and non-cat images.Since logistic regeression is a linear classifier we can see that it does well on the training examples of a small dataset but there is overfitting. [Click here](https://github.com/JoyKrishan/Joy-s_Course_Projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression%20as%20a%20Neural%20Network/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a.ipynb) to check the full implementation in a jupyter notebook.

![Simple Cat classifier using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/JoyKrishan/Joy-s_Course_Projects/blob/master/Deep%20Images/Cat_classifications_using_Logistic__regression.JPG)

 Number of iterations | Learning rate | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy 
 -------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- 
| 2000 | 0.5 | 99.04% | 70% |

1. **Deep Neural Network** - A four layer deep neural with relu and sigmoid as the activation functions. Since logistic regression is a linear classifier, this model learns better compared to the above mentioned model. It fits the data better with a good validation score as it learns interesting functions in each layer. [Click here](https://github.com/JoyKrishan/Joy-s_Course_Projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application_%20Image%20Classification/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application%20v8.ipynb) to check the full implementation in a jupyter notebook.

 Number of iterations | Learning rate | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy 
 -------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- 
| 2500 | 0.0075 | 98.56% | 80% |

1. **Deep Neural Network using Tensorflow framework** - A deep neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy. A 3-layer deep neural network where Xavier initialization is used for the weights and zero initialization for the bias. The model has variance problem(overfitted) which can be reduced by 
L2 regularization, dropout or getting more training data. [Click here](https://github.com/JoyKrishan/Joy-s_Course_Projects/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20using%20Tensorflow/Tensorflow%20Tutorial%20v3a.ipynb) to  check the full implementation

## Web Scrapping and generating the link graph using Page Rank Algorithm

Web scrapping using python to dump a given number of websites and calculate the pagerank using the number of inbound links to the website. Inbound links from a website with high pagerank value increases the pagerank to a greater value. 
I have used two starting urls to generate the graph below. In the images the bigger nodes have a greater pagerank value and will be better recognised by a search engine.
